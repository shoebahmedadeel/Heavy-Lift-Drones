# Heavy-Lift-Drone

  The market is going crazy about the heavy lift drones that can transport pacakages from
  one place to another. But developing such a system is not as easy as it seems to be or 
  looks like. There is a lot of effort put by the engineers and developers to get the vehicle
  airbone for so many number of hours before they get it in the market.
    For bigger projects like Amazons https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Prime-Air/b?node=8037720011 
  it would take a long time for them to deploy their systems but eventually in next few years 
  people struggling to create to day to day scenario of using rones will be the major players 
  not only in developing drones but also the market that it would open up because of numerous 
  applications that we cannot stop thinking about right now.
     Just to give an intro Below is the link of one of the projects that I have worked on payload
  delivery drones.
